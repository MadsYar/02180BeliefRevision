# 02180BeliefRevision

This project implements a belief revision system based on logical entailment and contraction principles. 
## File Structure

- `belief_base.py`: Contains the implementation of the `Belief` and `BeliefBase` classes.
- `main.py`: Includes test cases for belief revision postulates and serves as the entry point for the program.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python dependencies.

## Requirements

This project requires Python and the `sympy` library. Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

To execute the belief revision system and test the postulates, run the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will execute the predefined test cases and display the results in the terminal.
